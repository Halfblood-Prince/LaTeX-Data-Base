The former known as range and the latter known as endurance, have to be maximised for the success of the UAV flight mission.The chapter~\ref{chap: Optimum flight conditions Mars} and chapter~\ref{chap: Endurance} of this project report is aimed at maximising the range and endurance, respectively, of the Martian UAV. As the range and endurance of an aircraft does not change with atmospheric density, the optimisation is first done for flying on Earth. Later, the insights and formulas gained are extrapolated to the Martian atmosphere, to enable the aircraft adapt to the different environment there. \\ \\ \p The second part of the report anayses the impact of the design parameters of the wing viz, span, battery mass and payload mass, on range and endurance of the aircraft. The chapter~\ref{chap:design parameters} discusses how the range and endurance of the aircraft change when the design parameters of the wing are doubled. The wing design should balance the performance constraints and the weight constraints of the aircraft to result in the success of the Martian flight mission. \\ \\ \p Besides maximing the range and endurance of the Martian UAV, the latter part of the report deals with the installation of solar cells as the power source. Traditional battery-centric power systems contribute significantly to the overall mass of an aircraft, which imposes constraints on its flight dynamics and efficiency. By changing the power source of the UAV from battery-powered to solar-powered, the dilema of higher payload can be warded off to an extend. But before that, an assessment of the feasibility of installing a solar cell on the wings of the UAV has to be analysed thoroughly. The chapter~\ref{chap:Indefinite Flight} analyses this realm and puts forth the reasoning for the practicality of installing a solar cell for powering the UAV. By doing so, we embark on a journey to not only reduce the payload burden but also redefine the constraints of indefinite flight missions on the Martian landscape. \\ \pb } \newcommand{\conclusion}[0]{ \chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap: conclusion} \p In this project report, we have delved into the complexities of designing and optimizing aircraft for Mars exploration. Our findings shed light on critical factors that influence range, endurance, and overall performance of the aircraft. At varying altitudes within the Martian atmosphere, we identified the optimal velocities that maximize both range and endurance. These velocities are crucial for planning missions, ensuring efficient fuel utilization and extending flight time.\\ \\ \p In the second part of the report, we anaysed the impact of the design parameters of the wing — specifically, span, battery mass and payload mass — on range and endurance of the aircraft. Increasing the wing span enhances lift efficiency and reduces induced drag, allowing for longer flight times. However, it also introduces structural challenges and potential weight penalties. The mass of the battery on an aircraft has a direct impact on the endurance of the aircraft. It is widely understood that lighter batteries improve the efficiency of the aircraft, but it should be noted that they also limit the amount of energy that can be stored. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between weight reduction and energy storage capacity. In addition to battery mass, payload considerations also have a significant impact on mission objectives. Payload selection and distribution should be done with great care and attention to detail to ensure the successful completion of the mission. This is paramount in cases where the payload is critical to the mission's success. Our feasibility study explored the possibility of using solar cells as an alternative power source. By harnessing Martian sunlight, solar cells can significantly reduce reliance on heavy batteries and thereby enable indefinite flight. \\ \\ \p As humanity is endeavouring to colonise Mars in the future, our report serves as a foundation for designing efficient air transportation on Mars. This is a field of intensive development and drastic research as multinational conglomerates like SpaceX and Blue Origin are working on their vision of setting up a base station in Mars.\\ \pb} \newcommand{\DoLintroduction}[0]{ \textbf{Introduction} \begin{itemize} \item Akhil \end{itemize} \smallskip } \newcommand{\DoLconclusion}[0]{ \textbf{Conclusion} \begin{itemize} \item Akhil \end{itemize} } \newcommand{\DoLtaskfour}[0]{ \textbf{Influence of Design Variables} \begin{itemize} \item Akhil \end{itemize} \smallskip} \newcommand{\DesignParameters}[0]{ \chapter{Influence of design variables} \label{chap:Design Variables} \textbf{The calculation of glide slope is done again for an aircraft with:} \begin{itemize} \item [a.] A span which is twice as large \\ \eq{ Angle \ of \ glide \ (\gamma) \ = \ \arcsin\left(\frac{-D}{W}\right) }{eq:glide slope} \[ \gamma \ = \ \arcsin\left(\frac{-\frac{C_D \times W}{C_L}}{W}\right) \] \[ \gamma \ = \ \arcsin\left(-\frac{C_D}{C_L}\right) \] \eq{ \sin (\gamma) \ = \-\frac{-C_D}{C_L}  }{eq:glide ratio} When wingspan is doubled, the $ C_L $ and $ C_D $ are doubled, so the glide ratio $ \left(\frac{C_D}{C_L}\right) $ remains constant.\\ So from Equation~\ref{eq:glide ratio}, the glide slope remains constant and so does the maximum range. \item [b.] A total mass which is 1.5 times as large\\\\ When mass of the aircraft is made 1.5 times, the angle of glide remains same as it is not influenced by the aircraft's weight. So, the maximum glide range remains same. But the rate of descend increases by a factor of $\sqrt{1.5}$ \end{itemize} \pb }
